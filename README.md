Sentence Ax is a complete rewrite, from stem to stern, of Openie6.

https://github.com/dair-iitd/openie6

Sentence Ax decomposes a compound or complex sentence
into a set of simple sentences (extractions). It does this using 
supervised learning and transformer
Neural Nets.

Sentence Ax is a stand-alone app, but 
it's also 
a key component of the 
Mappa Mundi Project.
Both Sentence Ax and Mappa Mundi were
