    "IMP: There's a bug in Windows (it has been documented on the web) when you try to display TB logs in a jupyter cell. If a folder named \".tensorboard-info\" exists, it must be deleted or TB won't open.\n",

    "Tips:\n",
    "* There is no \"expand all\" button for expanding all the plot panes at once. However, if you search for _*, you will get a pane with all the plots in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For every scalar plot (i.e., 2D plot, with time on the X axis), you see a smoothed out curve-fit and a fainter unsmoothed curve fit. You can control the amount of smoothing of the smoothed one via a slider. When the smoothing is zero, the smoothed (unfaint) and unsmoothed (faint) curve-fits  coincide.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A menu allows one to choose among 3 options for time units along the X axis: \n",
    "    1. step number (e.g.,  step 3), \n",
    "    2. wall time (e.g.,  3:12 PM) \n",
    "    3. relative time (e.g.,  20:34 minutes since launch of experiment).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The plot with the Y axis labelled \"epoch\" took me a while to figure out. Assume X= step number, Y=epoch. Then the map X->Y is a **finite set of points** (FSP). Confusingly, instead of plotting that FSP, TB shows only two **continuous curve fits** (CCF) to that FSP, a smooth curve fit and an unsmoothed one (fainter). They could have plotted both the FSP (what is called a scatter plot) and the two CCFs, but instead plotted only the CCFs. When num_steps ~ 10 and num_epochs ~ 2, these two CCFs look weird because the number of points in the FSP is small (just 20). But if num_step ~ 1,000 and num_epochs ~ 5, then the number of points in the FSP grows (5000), and the two CCFs and the FSP start to merge. A fractional number of epochs does have an intuitive meaning: if 10.45 epochs have transpired, and the number of steps per epoch is 1,000, then 10,450 steps have transpired."
