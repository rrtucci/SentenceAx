Certainly! Let's walk through a simple example with explicit tensor values to understand how the transformation works. For this example, I'll use smaller tensor shapes for better visualization.

Assuming:
- `hidden_states` is a tensor with shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)` where `batch_size = 2`, `sequence_length = 4`, and `hidden_size = 3`.
- `batch.word_starts` is a tensor with shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)` representing word start positions, and the tensor contains index values.

```python
import torch

# Example hidden_states tensor
hidden_states = torch.tensor([
    [[0.1, 0.2, 0.3], [0.4, 0.5, 0.6], [0.7, 0.8, 0.9], [1.0, 1.1, 1.2]],
    [[1.2, 1.1, 1.0], [0.9, 0.8, 0.7], [0.6, 0.5, 0.4], [0.3, 0.2, 0.1]]
])

# Example batch.word_starts tensor
batch_word_starts = torch.tensor([
    [1, 2, 0, 2],
    [0, 3, 1, 2]
])

# Applying the transformation
word_hidden_states = torch.gather(hidden_states, 1,
    batch_word_starts.unsqueeze(2).
        repeat(1, 1, hidden_states.shape[2]))

print(word_hidden_states)
```

Output:
```
tensor([[[0.4, 0.5, 0.6],
         [0.7, 0.8, 0.9],
         [0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
         [0.6, 0.5, 0.4]],

        [[1.2, 1.1, 1.0],
         [0.3, 0.2, 0.1],
         [0.9, 0.8, 0.7],
         [0.6, 0.5, 0.4]]])
```

Explanation:
- For the first batch, the first row of `batch.word_starts` is `[1, 2, 0, 2]`, which means the words start at indices `[1, 2, 0, 2]` within each sequence. So, for the first row in `hidden_states`, we gather the second, third, first, and third vectors.
- Similarly, for the second batch, the second row of `batch.word_starts` is `[0, 3, 1, 2]`, indicating that words start at indices `[0, 3, 1, 2]` within each sequence.

The resulting `word_hidden_states` tensor contains the hidden state vectors corresponding to the word start positions for each batch and sequence. This operation essentially selects and gathers specific vectors from the `hidden_states` tensor based on the provided indices.
