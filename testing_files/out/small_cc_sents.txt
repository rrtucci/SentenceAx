Influential members of the House Ways and Means Committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings-and-loan bailout agency can raise capital , creating another potential obstacle to the government 's sale of sick thrifts .
Ways and Means



The bill , whose backers include Chairman Dan Rostenkowski -LRB- D. , Ill. -RRB- , would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an RTC-owned bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget .
bank or thrift issue debt



Such agency self-help borrowing is unauthorized and expensive , far more expensive than direct Treasury borrowing , said Rep. Fortney Stark -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- , the bill 's chief sponsor .
unauthorized and expensive



But the RTC also requires working capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold , until the assets can be sold separately .




That debt would be paid off as the assets are sold , leaving the total spending for the bailout at $ 50 billion , or $ 166 billion including interest over 10 years .

The agency has already spent roughly $ 19 billion selling 34 insolvent S&Ls , and it is likely to sell or merge 600 by the time the bailout concludes .

Moreover , it says the RTC 's total obligations may not exceed $ 50 billion , but that figure is derived after including notes and other debt , and subtracting from it the market value of the assets the RTC holds .

But Congress did n't anticipate or intend more public debt , say opponents of the RTC 's working-capital plan , and Rep. Charles Schumer -LRB- D. , N.Y . -RRB- said the RTC Oversight Board has been remiss in not keeping Congress informed .

That secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from Ways and Means , which seems to me sort of draconian , he said .
